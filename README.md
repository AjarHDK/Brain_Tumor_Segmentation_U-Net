# Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_U-Net

This repository contains two code notebooks focused on medical image segmentation using deep learning techniques. The tasks include:

- **2D Binary Segmentation**: Segmentation of brain MRI images into healthy and anomalous regions.
- **3D Multiclass Segmentation**: Segmentation of 3D brain MRI volumes into multiple classes, including different tumor regions.

## Notebooks

- **`2d_binary_segmentation.ipynb`**: Code for training and evaluating the U-Net model on 2D brain MRI images for binary segmentation.
- **`3d_multiclass_segmentation.ipynb`**: Code for training and evaluating a U-Net-based model for 3D multiclass segmentation on brain MRI volumes.
